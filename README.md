# JW Notice Board

This software is a Notice Board kiosk primarily for Kingdom Hall use, however a client version has been made which is easier to use on personal devices.
This software can be run on a Raspberry Pi, which this was originally intended for.
However you will need to find a way to install PyQT5 and PyQTWebEngine on your raspberry Pi.
Installing the bellow was able to solve this issue for myself:

This has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4b 8GB model (Raspbian), on Snapdragon 8C gen2 (Windowss 11 on Arm), Intel based processors, Windows on M1 Mac

This software is designed for touchscreen interfaces, but it can be used with keyboard and mouse.

Video viewing does not work through this, however audio does, so audio should be disabled or turned down when it is not needed.
